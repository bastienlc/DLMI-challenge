## Entrypoints

* [Baseline training](baseline.py)
* [Mixture of experts training](mixture_of_experts.py)
* [Mixture of experts cross validation](cross_validation.py)
* [Unsupervised classification](unsupervised_classification.ipynb)

Note that the SCAN code to create the unsuperivsed classes is not included in this repository because the model was not used in the end and the code is pretty consequent.
